# Decision_tree_regression
This is my first Machine Learning code. I practiced this while earning a certificate from Kaggle.
On the first half it uses Padas Library to load the data and uses Decision Tree Regression to predict price. It also validates data using validated data.
In the last part Random Forest Algorithm was used to decrease error of Mean Absolute Error(MEA)
